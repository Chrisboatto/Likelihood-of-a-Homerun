**Likelihood of a Home Run**

Home runs have emerged as the primary driver of run production in today's game of baseball, prompting teams to place a premium on players who deliver elite slugging percentages. This power-focused strategy makes sense in an analytics era where one big swing can erase deficits quickly. However, the question remains: do front offices exclusively chase these sluggers, or do they represent just one valuable player archetype among many?In this project, we explore that nuance by developing predictive models to estimate the probability of a home run in any individual at-bat. While high-slug players are undeniably a cornerstone for competitive rosters, successful organizations complement them with well-rounded athletes who contribute through superior on-base skills, speed on the bases, defensive excellence, and consistent contact. By leveraging detailed datasets, our models uncover the true drivers of home runs—batter mechanics, pitcher tendencies, situational context, and ballpark/environmental effects—revealing opportunities to identify undervalued power sources and challenging the notion that raw slugging percentage alone determines a player's offensive worth.
